        Privilege Leave (Vacation)
        
        All Regular employees are eligible for 22 days of Privilege leave every year.
        Employees are required to update their leave details on Workday prior to availing leave. Cancellation of leave should also be updated in a timely manner. In case of unavoidable/exceptional circumstances, where leave could not be applied in advance, vacations can be applied retroactively only upto one calendar month.

        PL availed in excess of PL accrued will be recovered from the employee at the time of leave year closure or Full and Final settlement, whichever is earlier.
        For the period when employee works part time, Privilege leave eligibility is prorated.
        Company holidays observed and sick leave (if raised and requested) during privilege leave is not deducted from the privilege leave balance.
        Employees are permitted to carry forward up to 12 days of privilege leave to the next year. This leave must be used by end of the next year or it will lapse. The carry forward eligibility is pro-rated by the number of days of service in the year for new hires.
        Encashment of earned unused privilege leave is available to employees upon retirement, separation or death. There is no annual encashment of such leave.
        Encashment amount = (Monthly Basic salary/22) * Number of days to be en-cashed.
        Guidelines for Employees on Host Country Assignment Model outside India (HCAM/IBMIUS)
        
        HCAM, IBMIUS or alternate landed model employees are excluded from all types of leaves included in the policy during assignment period.

For IBM sponsored mobility programs, this clause may be applicable as per the terms and conditions of the respective program.

For such employees, the leave entitlement, availing and carrying forward for the year in which they return after LOA, will be pro-rated after accounting for the period of the LOA.
